# Automated-Library-Logs-generator
This project is a website which is used to automate the process of manually entering the logs in the library register while entering or leaving the library.
At the entrance there is a scanner which scans the QR Code from the ID card and records the in time inside the library.
While leaving the library we need to scan the ID card again so that the exit time is recorded.
All this data which includes the ID number,Name ,Department and the in and out time is stored automatically inside a pdf file.
The pdf file is automatically printed at 5pm everyday and all the details are extracted and saved.
